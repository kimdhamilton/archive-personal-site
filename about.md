### Past

Co-created [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/) with MIT Media Lab, an open-source/open-standard method for anchoring Open Badges to blockchains, enabling improved decentralized verification.

Before falling into the sweet embrace of blockchain and self-sovereign identity, I focused on big data system design, algorithms, and implementation, and core library/API design and implementation.

In a past life, I blogged at the [.NET BCL (Base Class Libraries) team blog](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US?rq=site%3Ablogs.msdn.microsoft.com%2Fbclteam&rn=bclteam&ral=1&query=kim%2Bhamilton&ac=4). I was the dev owner for System.Collections, System.IO, and System.Resources, and obsessed over cold start performance, interface contracts, paths that are too long (yet not long enough), and trying to redeem the unredeemable SerialPort class -- bless it.

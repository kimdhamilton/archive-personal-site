### About

My current role is Architect of the [Digital Credentials Consortium](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/) -- a multi-university, international effort designing the future of academic credentials -- at MIT Open Learning. Our goal is to enable interoperable, standards-based credentials that put learners in control of their data.

I served several years as co-chair of the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/), pushing forward decentralized identity standards and solutions based on the Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifier (DID) specifications. 

I led design and development of the first open source DID method based on the Bitcoin blockchain, called the Bitcoin Reference (BTCR) DID method. ([BTCR project page](https://www.okimsrazor.com/project/btcr-project/))

My focus on decentralized, interoperable, learner-centric credentials began in 2016 when I co-created [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/) with the MIT Media Lab. We designed Blockcerts as an open-source/open-standard method for anchoring Open Badges to blockchains, improving decentralization aspects of badge verification.

Throughout my career, I've focused on scaleable system design, algorithms, and core library/API design.

I was previously a developer on the .NET BCL (Base Class Libraries) team. I was responsible for the System.Collections, System.IO, and System.Resources namespaces and blogged a fair bit on the [BCL team blog](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US?rq=site%3Ablogs.msdn.microsoft.com%2Fbclteam&rn=bclteam&ral=1&query=kim%2Bhamilton&ac=4). There my obsessions included cold start performance, interface contracts, paths that are too long (yet not long enough), and trying to remove barriers for those poor souls insistent on using the cursed SerialPort class -- bless it.

I wrote [Learning UML 2.0](https://smile.amazon.com/Learning-UML-2-0-Pragmatic-Introduction-ebook/dp/B0028N4WII/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=learning+uml+2.0&qid=1614793107&sr=8-2) back in the aughts, but not because I have a particular love of UML. Rather, I had to use it, did not enjoy any written material on the subject, and wanted to present UML in a more approachable way. Fortunately there's no UML 3 yet, and so the book remains oddly relevant.

I have a B.S. in Mathematics from University of Texas at Austin and an M.S. in Applied Math from Cornell. 

My mission is to expand opportunities to individuals through recognition of learning and skills gained beyond the traditional classroom.

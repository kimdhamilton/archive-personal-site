## BCTR
BTCR is a Decentralized Identifier (DID) method specification based on the bitcoin blockchain. I helped develop the initial versions of the BTCR method specification and implementations. 

It's completely open source, so you can experiment with the BTCR playground (which demonstrates BTCR DID lookup and creation), supporting libraries, and specifications around resolving BTCR DIDs. This is a community effort, and if you'd like to be involved, please let me know (@kimdhamilton on twitter).

## About DIDs
Decentralized Identifiers are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. It is an [emerging standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) which is currently W3C Working Group for continued development as an international standard.  

My [SSI Meetup](http://ssimeetup.org) webinar ["DIDs Demystified"](http://ssimeetup.org/dids-demystified-hands-intro-dids-btcr-did-method-kim-hamilton-duffy-webinar-5/) provides an introduction to DIDs that may be interesting for technically-oriented folks. In this webinar, I deep dive into the BTCR DID method spec, which is one of the simpler DID methods (and therefore easiest to understand from an implementation perspective). (Note: [SSI Meetup](http://ssimeetup.org) has many interesting webinars on the emerging self-sovereign identity stack, which I encourage you to check out.)
